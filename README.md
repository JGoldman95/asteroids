# asteroids
Repository for basic pygame Asteroids game

TODO:

    Minimum Viable Alpha Product:
    - Add starting screen
    - Add a scoring system
    - Implement multiple lives and respawning
    - Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing

    Enhancements on Alpha, Minimum Viable Beta:
    - Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
    - Add acceleration to the player movement
    - Add basic sound effects (shooting, explosions, etc.)
    - add bombs that can be dropped

    Enhancements on Beta, work towards Full Release 1.0:
    - Add a background image (optional, low priority)
    - Create different weapon types (key to beta expansion)
    - Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
    - Make the asteroid hitboxes match their shape (for advanced movement tech, could be hard)
    - Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one (vital for game feel)
    - Add a shield power-up
    - Add a speed power-up

Changelog:

    0.0.2 - refactored code, added "game over" screen, added replayability without having to relaunch.
